# Stealth Boilerplate Notes

## Getting Started
1. Run `composer install` from the root of the theme
2. If you do not have yarn, install yarn by running `npm install --global yarn`
3. Once you have yarn, run `yarn` from the theme directory to install dependencies
4. Choose which css pre-processor you would like to use in `webpack.mix.js`. Both LESS (default) and SASS available.
5. To use Browsersync be sure to set your local dev url `.browserSync('your-local-dev-url.test');`

 If using less, start with editing the `variables.less` file. 

<br><br>
## Development 
- `yarn start` — Compile assets when file changes are made, start Browsersync session
- `yarn build` — Compile and optimize the files in your assets directory
- `yarn build:production` — Compile assets for production

<br><br>
## Wordpress set up
- Edit `app/setup.php` to enable or disable theme features, setup navigation menus, post thumbnail sizes, and sidebars.
- Add custom filters to `app/filters.php`
- Add custom helper functions to `app/helpers.php`

<br><br>
## HTML and Blade Templates
- This Boilerplate has removed the original Sage code from `index.php`.
    - You can find the primary layout in `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`
    - You can find the `<head>` in `resources/views/layouts/header.blade.php`
    - You can find the closing `</body>` in `resources/views/layouts/footer.blade.php`
- Any blade components created in `resources/views/components` can be used in other blade files using this syntax:

```
/views/components/my-component.blade.php:
<x-my-component />
OR
/views/components/folder/my-component.blade.php
<x-folder.my-component />
```

- Blade components can only have 1 root elements
```
Correct:
______________
<div>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <h2>Hello Moon</h2>
</div>

Wrong:
______________
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>Hello Moon</h2>
```

- You can pass a variable to a component.
Example: We can set my-component's `$foo` variable as `$bar`
```
<x-my-component :foo="$bar" />
```
- For more on blade, see https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/blade
- Too create a new wordpress template, copy and paste the `template-custom.blade.php` found in `resources/views`. Then update the `Template Name:` comment at the top of the file.
- You can do php in blade 2 ways
    - For a single line of php you can use `@php()` ie. `@php($foo = 'bar')`
    - For multiple lines of php you can use `@php @endphp` ie
    ```
    @php
        $foo = array('item', 'item');
        do_someting($foo[0]);
    @endphp
    ```
  - Note: we noticed that sometimes `@php` does not work. use `<?php ?>` instead if that's the case
<br><br>

## Advanced Custom Fields Pro
- We commonly use Advanced Custom Fields Pro. Fields can be grabbed easily using this syntax `@php($foo = get_field('foo'))`
- To see the contents / array of the above `$foo` you can use `@dd()` ie. `@dd($foo)`. This will print the `$foo` values to the page.

Example:

    @php($flexible = get_field('flex_content'))
    @if($flexible)
        @foreach ($flexible as $flex)
            @if($flex['acf_fc_layout'] == 'my-component')
                <x-my-component :component="$flex" />
            @endif
        @endforeach
    @endif
    
<br><br>
## Components Library
- A library of components containing html, js, css, and php can be cloned into your `[THEME_ROOT]/resources/` directory. These can be easily copied and pasted in your project.
    - `git clone git@github.com:stealth-media/component_library.git`
- #### ** Please delete the `resources/components_library` when project is complete. **

<br><br>
## JS
- Use `resources/scripts/app.js` for main js scripts. 
- Find JavaScript snippets @ `resources/component_library/snippets.js`
- When installing new scripts with npm be sure to include the package at the top of `resources/scripts/app.js`. ie `npm install slideout`
```
import Slideout from 'slideout';
```
- jQuery is supported out of the box

<br><br>
## Grid & Bootstrap
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/layout/grid/
- The bootstrap grid is applied and can be found at `resources/less/common/bootstrap/grid.less`. To enable bootstrap css, uncomment "bootstrap.less" from `app.less`
- See `resources/less/common/mixins.less` for breakpoint mixins. ie. `.lg()`, `.md()`, `.sm()`, etc. These breakpoints mixins can be used to apply media query styling at to correct grid breakpoints. Breakpoint dimensions are written in comments of mixins
    
    Example:
    ```
    nav {
      font-size:20px;
      .md({
        font-size:15px; // applied to md and smaller
      });
    }
    ```
  
<br><br>
## Menus
- This Boilerplate includes a prebuilt Nav and Mega Nav
    - Find HTML @ `resources/views/partials/nav.blade.php` and `resources/views/partials/mega-nav.blade.php`. Include the nav you are using above `#panel` in `resources/layouts/header.blade.php`
    - Find CSS @ `resources/less/header.less`
    - Find JS @ `resources/scripts/app.js` `scroller()`
    
- This Boilerplate has been set up with a working Mobile Nav. Slideout js has been included for use in mobile nav. 
    - Find HTML @ `resources/views/partials/mobile-menu.blade.php` which has been included in `resources/views/layouts/header.blade.php`, 
    - CSS @ `resources/less/layouts/mobile-menu.less`
    - JS to handle slide out and nav buttons @ `resources/scripts/app.js` `mobileMenu()`
    - Note: When the mobile menu is activated, `#panel` will slide. If you have `position: fixed;` elements outside of `#panel` ie. the nav, be sure to add the class `.fixed-to-panel`. This will slide your fixed elements with the panel.
    <br><br>

## Scroll to animations
- This Boilerplate includes ready to use scroll to animations
- To use a scroll to animation, add the class `.animation-element` to an element you want to trigger a scroll to animation on. Once this element is in view, it will trigger the animation for itself and it's children. 
- You can find a library of animations in `resources/less/common/animations.less`
    - add the animation classes to elements you want to animate. (be sure the class in uncommented in `animations.less`)
    
    Example:
  
  Once `#my-div` is in view, it will fade in
    ```
  <div id="my-div" class="animation-element fade-in">Foobar<div>
    ```
  
  Once `#my-div` is in view, it's children will fade in.
    ```
   <div id="my-div" class="animation-element">
        <div class="fade-in">Foobar</div>
        <div class="fade-in">Foobar</div>
        <div class="fade-in">Foobar</div>
   <div>
    ```
  <small>Note: you do not need `animation-element` on every element you want to animate. `.animation-element` is just the element that triggers the animations once it's in view for itself and it's children.</small>
  #### Delays
  You may not want all children to animate at the same time. You can delay their animation by using the `.aniamtion-delay-#` class (see `animations.less` for list of animation delays)
  
  Example:
    ```
     <div id="my-div" class="animation-element">
          <div class="fade-in">Foobar</div> // Fades in first
          <div class="fade-in aniamtion-delay-2">Foobar</div> // Fades in 2ms later
          <div class="slide-in-right aniamtion-delay-4">Foobar</div> // Slides in 4ms later
     <div>
    ```
  
- You can find the javascript that controls the triggering of these animations at `resources/scripts/app.js` `animateOnScroll()`
